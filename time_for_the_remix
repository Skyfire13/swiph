I would like to change the way this interpreter works. I would like several
things to change.

0. (Dropping...for now) Move all functions to an appropriate header file

1. (Completed) The mem and reg arrays will be combined into a single array. The register
values will be the first values in the new mem array. 

2. (Completed )After the registers, the program will be loaded into memory

3. Where the actual loaded program loads to in the interperter's memory should
be easily changeable. It's incredibly likely I will need to have more values
stores than just the register values and it would be nice to not have to juggle
everything around in memory.

4. It will need a way to shift which item in the program's memory it should
reference based on the PC value, probably with just some simple addition
    - For example, I will need to change where the program loads to in mem
